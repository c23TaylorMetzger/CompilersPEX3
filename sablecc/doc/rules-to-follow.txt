Inlining rules ::

    1 -- Only non recursive productions can be inlined.
	    ex : prod = elem1 elem2 elem3 ** ok
	         prod = prod elem1        ** no

    2 -- We (at first time) try to inline productions which imply 
	 directly or undirectly a conflict.



   Implementation :

         %% Find a production imply in a conflict (Class Production.java in the code).

	 %% Hashtable of prod_transfrom and corresponding alt_transform.
	      exp
		    {-> exp} =
	        {plus}   exp plus factor
		    {-> New exp.plus(exp, factor.exp)   } 	|
		{minus}  exp minus factor
		    {-> New exp.minus(exp, factor.exp)  } 	|
                {factor} factor
		    {-> factor.exp};

			APlusExp.exp    ->  New exp.plus(exp, factor.exp)
			AMinusExp.exp   ->  New exp.minus(exp, factor.exp)
			AFactorExp.exp  ->  factor.exp

	      exp_list
		    {-> exp* } =
	        {list} exp  xexp_list_tail
	     	    {-> [exp xexp_list_tail.exp] } 		|
	        {single_start_word} begin exp T.end
	     	    {-> [exp] } 				|
	        {single_start_symbol} begin exp r_bkt
	     	    {-> [exp] } 				|
	        {single_start_word2} l_bkt exp T.end
	     	    {-> [exp] } 				|
	        {single_start_symbol2} l_bkt exp r_bkt
	     	    {-> [exp] };

		       AListExpList.exp		      ->  [exp xexp_list_tail.exp]
		       ASingleStartWordExpList.exp    ->  [exp]
		       ASingleStartSymbolExpList.exp  ->  [exp]
		       ASingleStartWord2ExpList.exp   ->  [exp]
		       ASingleStartSymbol2ExpList.exp ->  [exp]
	 
	 
	 :::: WARNING ::::
	      Symbol tables of alt_transform terms must be constructed only
	      when starting the inlining of this production.
	 %% Inline a production imply  ::
		   
		   - delete an alternative from a production and replace it
		     by a new inlined alternative (the result can be one or more alternatives).
		   
		   - transformation of alternatives in which this production occurs.
		   	 ** create one or more new alternative with the same 
			    elements except the one we want to transform.
			 ** For those new created alternatives, update their alt_transform
			    according to previous(old) alt_transform.
		   
		   - delete the production inlined from list of productions
		        ( AProductions.java : removeChild() ).
