The goal of the most Resolve*.java classes is essentially the semantic checks 
of the grammar.

-- ResolveIds.java : It performs the semantic checks of Productions section.
		     It was the only classes in SableCC2.x.x which performs
		     this job.
		     Now, for SableCC3.x.x, this class is still performing
		     his previous job, but it also construct symbol tables
		     for other Resolve classes.
